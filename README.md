# Blackjack card game
Making this game is part of a program i'm following at [SCRIPT](https://script.nl/) Groningen.  
It's a simplified version of Blackjack, so you can only 'Hit' or 'Stand',  
(and of course no betting).

Minimum requirements:
- add a deal, hit and stand button
- create (one) deck of cards and distribute cards in random order
- show playing cards of player / dealer
- show score (hand value of cards) of player / dealer
- inform player to hit / stand when score is below 21 points
- report winner / loser / tie ('push') at the end of the round

## Goals:
- Getting a better understanding of the basics of JavaScript
- Broaden my knowledge of CSS
- Take time and have fun
